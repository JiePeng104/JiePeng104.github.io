I am Jie Peng, a master's degree candidate at School of Cyberspace Science, Harbin Institute of Technology. I am part of the Big Data Security Lab, co-advised by Prof. [Hui He](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/huihe) and Prof. [Weizhe Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GOQFn7sAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) since 2022.

My research mainly focuses on reliable and interpretable machine learning, especially adversarial learning, backdoor learning and causal learning.
